--------------------------
## Intro
When you arrive at a total strange place, you found yourself alone.  
You've been told a monster is just a few kilometers away.  
Can you make yourself escape alive?  
Or perhaps, someone else could found you eaten.  
Yes, you can save your teammates.  
But that means giving up your own chance to make out alive quicker.  
Will you join this adventure?  

## Play Method
In the map, each team is randomly spawned in separate places, fight against other players in a limited map, and survives to the end to be the final winner.
